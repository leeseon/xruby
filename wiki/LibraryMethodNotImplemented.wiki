#summary Library Method Not Implemented

If you find a method not implemented,feel free to report it here. Of course,we welcome that you implement them and share with us.

_Rubinius has lots builtin methods written in pure ruby, we could use some of their implementations. To keep their copyright, better put all these migrated code in a single file and then load it at runtime._
