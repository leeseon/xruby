#summary Draft for code convension

== Introduction ==
Code Convension for XRuby project, to make our code more readable

This document based on Coding Guidelines of Globus
[http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/coding_guidelines.html]

== Details ==
=== Base coding conventions ===
Use the Sun Coding Conventions for the Java Programming Language:

http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html 
=== Statements ===
==== Import Statements ====
All imports must be single class and explicit. In other words,
{{{
import org.xruby.runtime.value.*;
}}}
is not allowed.
{{{
import com.xruby.runtime.value.ObjectFactory;
import com.xruby.runtime.value.RubyArray;
}}}
is preferred.

=== Variables ===
No acronyms or abbreviations should be used.



For example,
{{{
 a = b + mVarLen 
}}}
should be avoided. Use this instead:
{{{
totalLength = partLength + newLength
}}}

==== Instance Variables ====
Use this. as the prefix when referencing instance variables. For example,
{{{
public MyClass (ServicePropertiesInterface properties) {
     this.properties = properties;
}

public int foo () {
    int localInt = 3;
    return this.instanceInt + localInt;
}
}}}
Instance variables should never be declared public. If instance variables need to be accessed from outside of the class then use getters/setters.

We leave it to the implementers' discretion to choose between protected and private as appropriate.

==== Constant Variable ====
For constant variable(static final), Underscore Uppercase style is highly recommended. 
{{{
private static final RubyValue OBJECT_SPACE_MODULE = ... ; // Uppercase and underscore
}}}

=== Layout ===
==== Indentation ====

All indentation levels should be *four (4) spaces*.

No editor tabs are allowed unless they are converted to four spaces before saving the file.

==== Brackets ====
* Curly brackets {} are put on separate lines. This is never allowed:
{{{
      // Wrong style
      for (index = 0; index < length; index++)
      {
           <code>
      }
}}}
* As defined in the Java Coding guidelines. This is highly recommended:
{{{
      for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {
           <code>
      }
}}}
* One-Liners

Even single line statements should be inside brackets. E.g.
{{{
if (isEmpty) {
     return true;
}
}}}
And, this is not recommended:
{{{
if (isEmpty) 
    return true;
}}}

=== Exceptions ===
We high recommend you should throw a customized Exception extending RubyException and RubyRuntimeException(We need create this Exception), please don't throw the built-in Java Exceptions.
