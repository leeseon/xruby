#summary How to Contribute

= Introduction =

We always welcome contributors.

= Guidelines =

We appreciate *clean code with tests*. When you fix a bug or add a new features, we encourage you to write a test (test driven is better). Before commiting a change, it is best to run the all tests to ensure nothing is broken. There two sets of test, one is written or embedded in Java, and you can invoke them by doing:

>build test

The other set of tests are written in Ruby, and you runthem by doing:
>java -jar xruby-0.1.0.jar sample\test.rb

While it is impossible to implement something perfectly at the first attempt, refactoring becomes very improtant. If the change may affect the work if other contributors, just send a email to xruby-devel malilist.

Other than the above gernal guidelines, feel free to make changes.

= License =
Contributors own the copyright of their contributions. If you made significant contributions in a source file, please add your name to the Copyright block.

By contributing your work to XRuby project, you agreed to release the source code as GPL v2 license.

= GetStarted =

Please read [XRubyHackingGuide] first, it gives you an overview of the implementation.

The easier way to jump start is to implement a few builtin libraries. And almost all of our members started this way. By implementing builtin libraries, it helps you understand how the runtime/compiler works.
